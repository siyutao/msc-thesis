\addchap{Abstract}
Issues of verbal valency has long occupied a central place in the study of argument structure and the interface between lexicon and grammar. However, the cross-lingual comparison of valency systems and their general typology have proved challenging due to both disagreements on the linguistic basis of comparison and the difficulty in arriving at categorical types. In this thesis, I propose information-theoretic metrics to characterize the complexity of verbal valency at a lexical level and experiment using morphosyntactically annotated data from the Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks. The aim of the proposed quantitative typological study is to explore the utility and limits of quantitative methods and dependency-annotated corpora in the cross-lingual comparison of verbal valency systems, in hopes that it may also yield quantitative insights on the complex issue.
